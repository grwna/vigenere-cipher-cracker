================================= TEXTS USED ===================================
Text 1
Wherever a process of life communicates an eagerness to him who lives it, there the life becomes genuinely significant. Sometimes the eagerness is more knit up with the motor activities, sometimes with the perceptions, sometimes with the imagination, sometimes with reflective thought. But, wherever it is found, there is the zest, the tingle, the excitement of reality; and there is importance in the only real and positive sense in which importance ever anywhere can be. I remember standing on a street corner with the black painter Beauford Delaney down in the Village waiting for the light to change, and he pointed down and said, Look. I looked and all I saw was the water. And he said, Look again, which I did, and I saw oil on the water and the city reflected in the puddle. It was a great revelation to me. I cant explain it. He taught me how to see, and how to trust what I saw. Painters have often taught writers how to see. And once youve had that experience, you see differently.

Because that’s all there is. The response. This is not to dismiss the immense difficulty of any of these ordeals. It is rather, to first, be prepared for them — humble and aware that they can happen. Next, it is the question: Will we resist breaking? Or will we accept the will of the universe and seek instead to become stronger where we were broken? Death or Kintsugi? Fragile or, to use that wonderful phrase from Nassim Taleb, Antifragile? Not unbreakable. Not resistant. Because those that cannot break, cannot learn, and cannot be made stronger for what happened. - Ryan Holiday

So, if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life, then you won’t see why we go. - George Mallory
